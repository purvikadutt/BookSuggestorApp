# MVC as the design framework


## Context
Since the project has a short timeframe, one of the important factors considered were decoupling of the main features of the application.

## Decision
The decision was made to use an MVC style architecture to allow component separation among the different features.

## Consequences
The application will have many features which will be independent from each other so any changes to one feature will not impact another feature.
