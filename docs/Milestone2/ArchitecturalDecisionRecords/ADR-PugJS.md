# Using Pug.JS as a Template Engine

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Initially, the choices being considered for the front end of the application were between using HTML(directly) or using Pug.JS.

## Decision
If pure HTML was used, it would require substantial effort and increased overall code size to support multiple views. Instead, the final decision was made to settle on Pug.JS as it supports view templating and logic for displaying individual components.

## Consequences
Pug.JS will require some extra development effort to learn.
